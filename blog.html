        <p>If you're a child of the 80s or 90s, Ewoks may have captured your imagination. You may have watched not one, 
            but two made-for-TV (and made for merchandising) Ewok movies. You may have Yub Nubbed with these fuzzy natives of Endor when they helped the Rebels overthrow a Galactic Empire (really?!?!) There may actually be a
            you didn't know or realize about the Ewoks...</p>

        <h2>Disturbing Things About Ewoks:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>They'd already met Leia and were still ready to eat her friends</li>
            <li>And not just eat them, but roast them alive in an excruciating death</li>
            <li>How'd they get that dress for Leia if they hadn't previusly killed and eaten a similiarly sized woman? <a href="https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/1386393326031605760" target="_blank">Mark Hamill can't even...</a></li>
            <li>Obviously experienced at asymetrical guerilla warfare to defeat the Empire, this is not the first regime they've overthrown</li>
            <li>They don't wear pants</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Somehow Luke Skywalker and friends put this all behind them and Yub Nub the next day!</p>
